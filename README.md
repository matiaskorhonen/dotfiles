# Matt's dot files

Just my dot files. Use them if you can...

> [!CAUTION]
> * I don't take responsibility for anything at all
> * If you're going to use these dotfiles, you should probably fork this repo and edit as necessary

## Prerequisites

* Git
* [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh) should be installed in the `~/.oh-my-zsh` directory
* The install script needs [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) but it can automatically download a temporary copy of it on macOS and Linux.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You probably want to read what the install script does before running it as it will do things without prompting firstâ€¦

1. Clone the repository

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/matiaskorhonen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```

2. Run the install script

    ```sh
    ./install.sh
    ```
