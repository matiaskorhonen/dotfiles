# Matt's dot files

Just my dot files. Use them if you can...

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matiaskorhonen/dotfiles.git
```

There's a Rake task that you can use to install the appropriate symlinks, but
it's pretty crude and makes some assumptions (for example that Oh My Zsh is
installed in `~/.oh-my-zsh`)

## Caveats

* I don't take responsibility for anything at all
* If you're going to use these dotfiles, you should probably fork this repo and edit as necessary
